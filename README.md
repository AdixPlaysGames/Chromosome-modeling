## Chromosome Modeling and Hi-C Matrices

Chromosome modeling refers to the process of creating 3D representations of chromosomes, based on their spatial organization within the nucleus. One widely-used technique in chromosome modeling is **Hi-C** (High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture), which captures the frequency of interactions between different parts of the genome. These interactions help reveal how DNA folds and organizes in 3D space.

### Single-cell Hi-C
**Single-cell Hi-C** provides information about chromosomal interactions at the individual cell level, offering more detailed insights into variability between cells. Unlike bulk Hi-C, which averages data across many cells, single-cell Hi-C gives a higher resolution view of the structural variability within a population.

### Hi-C Matrices
The result of Hi-C experiments is a contact matrix, where each cell in the matrix represents the frequency of interactions between two genomic regions. These matrices can be used to model the 3D structure of chromosomes, as higher interaction frequencies suggest closer spatial proximity between regions of DNA.
